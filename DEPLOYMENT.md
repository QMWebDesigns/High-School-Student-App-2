# - Hosting (optional)
```

#### GitHub Integration
```bash
# Update src/services/githubService.ts with:
# - Your GitHub Personal Access Token
# - Your repository name
# - Branch name (usually 'main')
```

### 2. Build and Test
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview  # Test the production build locally
```

### 3. Deploy to Vercel (Recommended)

1. **Connect Repository**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Import your GitHub repository

   VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   - Click "Deploy"
   - Vercel will automatically build and deploy

### 4. Deploy to Netlify

1. **Build Locally**
   ```bash

## Post-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Functionality Tests
- [ ] Visit the deployed URL
- [ ] Test user registration
- [ ] Test admin login (admin@example.com)
- [ ] Test student dashboard
- [ ] Test survey submission
- [ ] Test admin dashboard
- [ ] Test PDF upload (if GitHub token configured)
- [ ] Test paper management

### ✅ Performance Tests
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] Responsive design on mobile
- [ ] Dark mode toggle working
- [ ] All animations smooth

### ✅ Security Checks
- [ ] Environment variables not exposed
- [ ] Firebase security rules configured
- [ ] HTTPS enabled
- [ ] No console errors

## Admin Access Information

**Admin Email Addresses:**
- `admin@example.com`
- `admin@school.com`

**How to Access:**
1. Sign up with one of the admin emails
2. Use any password
3. Sign in with the same credentials
4. You'll be redirected to the Admin Dashboard

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Firebase Connection Errors**
   - Check Firebase configuration
   - Ensure services are enabled
   - Verify API keys

2. **GitHub Upload Failures**
   - Check GitHub token permissions
   - Verify repository access
   - Check file size limits (25MB)

3. **Build Failures**
   - Run `npm run typecheck`
   - Run `npm run lint`
   - Check for missing dependencies

4. **Authentication Issues**
   - Verify Firebase Auth is enabled
   - Check email/password provider
   - Test with different browsers

## Support

For deployment issues:
1. Check the browser console for errors
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Test locally with `npm run preview`
4. Check Firebase and GitHub service status

## Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:
- ✅ All pages load without errors
- ✅ Authentication works for both users and admins
- ✅ Students can browse and download papers
- ✅ Admins can upload and manage papers
- ✅ Survey system collects data
- ✅ Analytics display correctly
- ✅ Mobile responsive design works
- ✅ Dark mode functions properly

## Next Steps

After successful deployment:
1. Set up monitoring (Vercel Analytics, etc.)
2. Configure custom domain (optional)
3. Set up automated backups
4. Plan for scaling (if needed)
5. Gather user feedback
6. Plan future features
